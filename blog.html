            <h3 class="fst-italic"><u>Difference among var, let and const:</u></h3>
            <p>var is the traditional way of declaring variables in JavaScript and it is globally scoped, it is
                considered a bad practice in JavaScript to declare variables with var nowadays.
                let and const were introduced as a new way to declare variables with ES6.
                With let, you may reassign the value but the variable will only be used inside the block it was defined
                in and not outside, kind of like having its own scope.
                you cannot reassign the value if you declared the variable as const</p>
            <h3 class="fst-italic"><u>Difference between the arrow function and regular function:</u></h3>
            <p>Arrow functions – a new feature introduced in ES6 – enable writing concise functions in JavaScript. While
                both regular and arrow functions work in a similar manner, yet there are certain interesting differences
                between them. Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and
                callable. Since regular
                functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However, the arrow functions are
                only callable
                and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions.</p>
            <h3 class="fst-italic"><u>Why we are use templet string:</u></h3>
            <p>Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us
                insert/interpolate variables
                and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It
                allows us to create
                strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements. Another great thing that comes with template
                strings are tags.
                Tags are functions that take a string and the decomposed parts of the string as parameters and are great
                for converting
                strings to different entities.</p>
            <h3 class="fst-italic"><u>When we used map, find. filter and for each:</u></h3>
            <p><b>map: </b>map is used when you want to transform elements in an array.</p>
            <p><b>find: </b>find is used When you want to select a single element from an array.</p>
            <p><b>filter: </b>filter is used when you want to select a subset of multiple elements from an array.</p>
            <p><b>for-each: </b>To me, the most compelling case for using .forEach() in favor of a for loop is that it’s
                easier. Even though it’s the
                same number of lines, there’s less setup. With .forEach() you simply pass a function that is executed on
                each element in the array.</p>
